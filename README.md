# podcast-app-lambda
A simple podcast player app that enables searching podcasts from iTunes and playing the episodes.

The podcast search uses [iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/).

The podcast rss feed fetching and parsing is done using a serverless AWS lambda function via [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) to avoid CORS issues and the use of a proxy server.

## Prerequisites
You need to have npm and Node.js installed to run this app on your computer.

## Installing
Clone the project and install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/hjkar1/podcast-app-lambda
cd podcast-app-lambda
npm install
```

## Deploying to Netlify
You need a Netlify account to deploy this app.

Deploying with [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/):

1. Install Netlify CLI.
2. Build the app with `npm run build`.
3. Use `netlify login` to authenticate.
4. Run `netlify deploy --prod` in the project root folder. 

## Tests
The app includes unit and integration tests for React components.

## Using ESLint
Use `npm run lint` to run ESLint.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
